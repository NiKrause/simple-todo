# Simple Todo - A Local-First Peer-to-Peer Demo App

A decentralized, local-first, peer-to-peer todo application built with **libp2p**, **IPFS**, and **OrbitDB**. This app demonstrates how modern Web3 technologies can create truly decentralized applications that work entirely in the browser.

## üöÄ Live Demo

- **HTTP**: https://simple-todo.le-space.de
- **IPFS (dweb.link)**: https://dweb.link/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dg7m2i3qftmdjl4t8jh74xzyz1ovsrkgdcdyn1ftaum3laom7qs
- **IPFS (le-space)**: https://ipfs.le-space.de/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dg7m2i3qftmdjl4t8jh74xzyz1ovsrkgdcdyn1ftaum3laom7qs

## üéØ What is this?

This is a **browser only** local-first peer-to-peer todo application that operates without any traditional server infrastructure. It connects directly to other browsers and mobile devices through peer-to-peer connections, creating a truly decentralized experience. So far a LibP2P signaling node is necessary to connect the peers and in this version it also stores the todo's since this browser version works with MemoryStorage only instead of local IPFSStorage (e.g. LevelBlockstore).   

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **No Server Required** - Runs entirely in your browser 
- ‚úÖ **Local Data** - data is stored in your browsers level storage and replicated via OrbitDB and IPFS
- ‚úÖ **Peer-to-Peer Communication** - Browsers connect directly via WebRTC (with help of signaling nodes)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Synchronization** - Changes appear instantly across all peers
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Identity** - Fresh peer ID generated on each load

## üéØ How to Test

1. **Open Two Browser Windows** - You need at least two browser instances, a mobile or ask another distant person to open the app
2. **Load the Same URL** - all app users should load the same app URL
3. **Accept Consent** - Check all consent boxes in both browsers
4. **Wait for Connection** - The app will automatically discover and connect peers
5. **Add Todos** - Create todos in one browser and watch them appear in the other
