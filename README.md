# Simple Todo - A Local-First Peer-to-Peer Demo App

A basic decentralized, local-first, peer-to-peer todo application built with **libp2p**, **IPFS**, and **OrbitDB**. This app demonstrates how modern Web3 technologies can create truly decentralized applications that work entirely in the browser.

## 🎯 What is this?

This is a **browser-only** local-first peer-to-peer todo application that operates without any traditional server infrastructure. It connects directly to other browsers and mobile devices through peer-to-peer connections, creating a truly decentralized experience. So far, a LibP2P signaling node is necessary to connect the peers, and in this version it also stores the todos since this browser version works with MemoryStorage only instead of local IPFSStorage (e.g. LevelBlockstore).

### Main Branch Scope

The `main` branch is the basic shared-list demo. Every browser opens the same default OrbitDB database (`simple-todos`); users only load the app URL, accept consent, and add todos. There is no manual OrbitDB address exchange in this branch. A Playwright E2E test verifies the default flow with Alice and Bob in separate browser contexts: each adds three todos, and both browsers must see all six replicated items.

> **Another tutorial path:** The [`collab01`](https://github.com/NiKrause/simple-todo/tree/collab01) branch demonstrates explicit collaboration: users can create or load a todo database by its OrbitDB address, share it with another peer, and replicate changes through the relay.

### Key Features

- ✅ **No Server Required** - PWA runs in browser, desktop or mobile.
- ✅ **Local Data** - Data is stored in your browser's level storage and replicated via OrbitDB and IPFS
- ✅ **Peer-to-Peer Communication** - Browsers connect directly via WebRTC (with help of libp2p signaling nodes)
- ✅ **Real-time Synchronization** - Changes appear instantly across all peers

## 🎯 How to Test

1. **Open Two Browser Windows** - You need at least two browser instances, a mobile device, or ask another distant person to open the app
2. **Load the Same URL** - All app users should load the same app URL
3. **Accept Consent** - Check all consent boxes in both browsers
4. **Wait for Connection** - The app will automatically discover and connect peers
5. **Add Todos** - Create todos in one browser and watch them appear in the other

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/NiKrause/simple-todo.git
# checkout main branch
git checkout main

# run (like this you don't need to cut and paste anything)
./tutorial-01.js
```

## 🛰️ Local Relay

In development the app reads `VITE_RELAY_BOOTSTRAP_ADDR_DEV` from `.env`. If that variable is not set, it falls back to a hardcoded localhost relay address, so the safest local workflow is:

1. Start an `orbitdb-relay` process.
2. Copy its WebSocket multiaddr into `.env`.
3. Start or restart the Vite dev server.

Install and run the published npm package:

```bash
npm install -g orbitdb-relay

ENABLE_GENERAL_LOGS=1 \
RELAY_LISTEN_IPV4=127.0.0.1 \
RELAY_DISABLE_IPV6=true \
RELAY_DISABLE_QUIC=true \
RELAY_DISABLE_WEBRTC=true \
DATASTORE_PATH=/tmp/simple-todo-orbitdb-relay \
orbitdb-relay --test
```

The relay exposes helper routes on `http://127.0.0.1:9090`. In another terminal, fetch the browser-dialable WebSocket address:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9090/multiaddrs | node -e "let d=''; process.stdin.on('data', c => d += c); process.stdin.on('end', () => { const j = JSON.parse(d); console.log(j.best.websocket || j.byTransport.websocket[0]); });"
```

Use exactly one printed `/ws` address. Do not paste the raw TCP address on port `9091`, and do not include quotes, commas, or multiple addresses in one value.

Put the printed address in `.env`. If you copied `.env.example`, replace the existing `VITE_RELAY_BOOTSTRAP_ADDR_DEV` value:

```bash
VITE_RELAY_BOOTSTRAP_ADDR_DEV=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9092/ws/p2p/<relay-peer-id>
```

Then start the app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If you change `.env` while Vite is already running, restart `pnpm dev` so the new relay address is loaded.
