# Simple Todo - A Local-First Peer-to-Peer Demo App

A basic decentralized, local-first, peer-to-peer todo application built with **libp2p**, **IPFS**, and **OrbitDB**. This app demonstrates how modern Web3 technologies can create truly decentralized applications that work entirely in the browser.

## 🚀 Live Demo

- **HTTP**: https://simple-todo.le-space.de
- **IPFS (dweb.link)**: https://dweb.link/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dg7m2i3qftmdjl4t8jh74xzyz1ovsrkgdcdyn1ftaum3laom7qs
- **IPFS (le-space)**: https://ipfs.le-space.de/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dg7m2i3qftmdjl4t8jh74xzyz1ovsrkgdcdyn1ftaum3laom7qs

## 🎯 What is this?

This is a **browser-only** local-first peer-to-peer todo application that operates without any traditional server infrastructure. It connects directly to other browsers and mobile devices through peer-to-peer connections, creating a truly decentralized experience. So far, a LibP2P signaling node is necessary to connect the peers, and in this version it also stores the todos since this browser version works with MemoryStorage only instead of local IPFSStorage (e.g. LevelBlockstore).

### About the `collab01` branch

The main/basic demo focuses on one automatic shared todo list: open the same app in two browsers, connect peers, and watch todos replicate.

The `collab01` branch adds an explicit collaboration workflow. Each browser shows its current OrbitDB todo database address, lets you copy it, and lets another browser load that exact database through the **Load Todo DB** card. It also keeps the manual **Connect To Multiaddress** flow, so testers can dial a browser-reachable relay or peer address before opening a collaborator's database. This makes the demo better for validating cross-browser collaboration, relay connectivity, and OrbitDB replication behavior step by step.

### Key Features

- ✅ **No Server Required** - Runs entirely in your browser
- ✅ **Local Data** - Data is stored in your browser's level storage and replicated via OrbitDB and IPFS
- ✅ **Peer-to-Peer Communication** - Browsers connect directly via WebRTC (with help of libp2p signaling nodes)
- ✅ **Real-time Synchronization** - Changes appear instantly across all peers
- ✅ **Load Shared Databases** - Open another user's todo database by pasting its OrbitDB address
- ✅ **Copyable Database Address** - Share the active todo database address directly from the UI

## 🎯 How to Test

1. **Open Two Browser Windows** - You need at least two browser instances, a mobile device, or ask another distant person to open the app
2. **Load the Same URL** - All app users should load the same app URL
3. **Accept Consent** - Check all consent boxes in both browsers
4. **Connect Peers** - Wait for discovery or use **Connect To Multiaddress** with a browser-reachable relay or peer address
5. **Share the Todo DB** - Copy Alice's OrbitDB address from **Load Todo DB** and load it in Bob's browser
6. **Add Todos** - Create todos in either browser and watch them replicate to the other

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/NiKrause/simple-todo.git
# checkout collaboration branch
git checkout collab01

# run (like this you don't need to cut and paste anything)
./tutorial-01.js
```

## 🛰️ Local Relay

In development the app reads `VITE_RELAY_BOOTSTRAP_ADDR_DEV` from `.env`. If that variable is not set, it falls back to a hardcoded localhost relay address, so the safest local workflow is:

1. Start an `orbitdb-relay` process.
2. Copy its WebSocket multiaddr into `.env`.
3. Start or restart the Vite dev server.

Install and run the published npm package:

```bash
npm install -g orbitdb-relay

ENABLE_GENERAL_LOGS=1 \
RELAY_LISTEN_IPV4=127.0.0.1 \
RELAY_DISABLE_IPV6=true \
RELAY_DISABLE_QUIC=true \
RELAY_DISABLE_WEBRTC=true \
DATASTORE_PATH=/tmp/simple-todo-orbitdb-relay \
orbitdb-relay --test
```

The relay exposes helper routes on `http://127.0.0.1:9090`. In another terminal, fetch the browser-dialable WebSocket address:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9090/multiaddrs | node -e "let d=''; process.stdin.on('data', c => d += c); process.stdin.on('end', () => { const j = JSON.parse(d); console.log(j.best.websocket || j.byTransport.websocket[0]); });"
```

Use exactly one printed `/ws` address. Do not paste the raw TCP address on port `9091`, and do not include quotes, commas, or multiple addresses in one value.

Put the printed address in `.env`. If you copied `.env.example`, replace the existing `VITE_RELAY_BOOTSTRAP_ADDR_DEV` value:

```bash
VITE_RELAY_BOOTSTRAP_ADDR_DEV=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9092/ws/p2p/<relay-peer-id>
```

Then start the app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If you change `.env` while Vite is already running, restart `pnpm dev` so the new relay address is loaded.
